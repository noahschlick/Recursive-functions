# Recursive-functions
Multiple functions that operate on recursion 

The purpose of this program is to test 4 recursive functions that operate different task. The first function takes three non-negative integer parameters star, diff, and n and returns the nth value in the arithmetic progression starting at star, with difference diff. The third function (stdDevArray) calculates the standard deviation of a, array of numbers. The fourth function (encrypt) takes in a string and encrypts the string using a simple key.
